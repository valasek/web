### How do consultations work?

**If you are interested:**

- **Prepare a description of the situation** you are in and what the ideal outcome and desired change are.
- **Contact me. The first meeting is an introductory one. Based on the [non-binding phone consultation](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2sepIGc8sosu7oevx1Xk3fYGiGule7mdjFghy02Uxslk_TfTEAKBMw2bsN5Ja3WZ4nHWgMTcsM) lasting 15 - 30 minutes, we will agree on the next steps and timing.** It is also possible to meet in person in Bratislava, Prague, or the surrounding area. You will take away a few insights from the first meeting, but its primary purpose is to communicate your goals and agree on the next steps.
- Subsequent consultations can take place **online, by phone, or in person in Bratislava**, for example at [HubHub](https://www.hubhub.com/location/bratislava-nivy-tower/), **in Prague** at a suitable coworking space, or at a location **by arrangement**.
- **Consultations are typically 60 - 90 minutes long** â€“ we will set them individually according to your needs.
- The consultation fee includes **phone support between consultations** for multiple hours. Most challenging changes require a longer time and a series of connected changes, and during the time between consultations, you will have an advisor available by phone.
- **Consultations can be canceled no later than 12 hours in advance; otherwise, they are counted as completed** (please contact me as soon as you know you need to cancel the appointment).
