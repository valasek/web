"During our mentoring journey, EmpowerHer shared with me a wealth of useful tools, techniques and insights that helped me further develop my skills and self-awareness.

Stanislav creates a safe and open space for mentoring and it's easy to share even more personal thoughts and dilemmas with him.

I warmly recommend Stanislav as a mentor and coach!"

"Well grounded discussions. In fact, you have followed all the steps of GROWTH coaching process including right questions lead to finding options and solutions without judgemental mindset.

Your questions got me hooked to the discussions and final goal finding path."

"His approach, focused on body awareness and inner experience, served as an excellent guide to deeper self-understanding and solution-finding. Although some of his suggestions initially surprised me, they ultimately helped me realize many important things about myself.

This wouldn’t have been possible without the safe space and Stanislav’s sensitive and respectful approach — which he managed to create even in an online setting."

"Stanley always listens deeply and attentively to what the client says. Thanks to his experience and the systems he has integrated, he is able to look at a problem from a broader perspective and help guide me toward my desired goal.

To me, he’s someone with an open heart — and what stands out the most is that he feels more than he thinks."

I am pleased to provide a reference for Stanislav, whom I have had the privilege of working with through the [Femme Palette](https://www.femmepalette.com) mentoring program aimed at strengthening women’s position in IT. Stanislav has demonstrated exceptional commitment to the program, consistently offering his guidance with a genuine desire to empower me and address all the mentoring goals we identified.

He has a profound understanding of the unique strengths women bring to IT management, particularly their collaborative leadership style, attention to detail, and resilience. 

Stanislav is not only generous with his time and knowledge, but he also shares his life experiences openly, creating a supportive environment that encourages learning and confidence-building. His willingness to help, coupled with his deep insight into IT, makes him an excellent mentor and an advocate for advancing women in technology.

I highly recommend Stanislav for any future mentoring roles, as his passion for diversity and empowerment truly elevates the quality of mentorship and strengthens the future of IT leadership.

I shared four years full of challenges and mutual inspiration with Stanislav. During that time, I was his fellow manager and also his mentor in leading his team. In hindsight, however, I contemplate who mentored whom more often. Stanislav has a unique ability to articulate context and add perspective on complex issues related to personal development. His insights enabled me to find solutions where I would have never looked for them myself, and which I would not have discovered without his help.

Stanislav has long been an inspiration to me, a mentor, a coach, and the person who brought me into IT. He has been a support to me and has continually pushed me forward. He never wavered and managed to describe the situation at hand and find solutions. Thanks to him, I am where I am today, and I am grateful for it. His energy during our conversations fascinated me and earned my admiration.

I had my first meeting with Stanislav Valášek, where we discussed the current state of my work team, which I would like to take to the next level.

Right from this first meeting, I am taking away several "aha moments" about what to focus on and what to change for us to function better as a team. I look forward to continuing and having further meetings with the whole team and Stanislav as the guide through this change. Thank you! 🙏👌

I went on a journey with Stanislav to Grosser Priel. It was my very first high-altitude experience, and I believe I couldn't have been in better hands. The whole journey was an incredibly powerful emotional experience. I overcame myself and got to know myself a little more. Stanislav handles any situation excellently and is a support and a true partner/guide. I recommend him to both beginners and experienced "mountaineers."
