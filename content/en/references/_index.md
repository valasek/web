Friends, if you feel that you need to change something in your life, that something is pulling you somewhere, if you hear that inner voice daily telling you to do something but don't know what, then know that Stanislav Valášek is a coach, mentor, simply put - he's a person who has helped me significantly multiple times to look into my inner self. He does it in an interesting way... and you know what, try to reach out to him and find out how he works. Or visit his website where you can learn more about him...

I am pleased to provide a reference for Stansilav, whom I have had the privilege of working with through the [Femme Palette](https://www.femmepalette.com) mentoring program aimed at strengthening women’s position in IT. Stanislav has demonstrated exceptional commitment to the program, consistently offering his guidance with a genuine desire to empower me and address all the mentoring goals we identified.

He has a profound understanding of the unique strengths women bring to IT management, particularly their collaborative leadership style, attention to detail, and resilience. 

Stanislav is not only generous with his time and knowledge, but he also shares his life experiences openly, creating a supportive environment that encourages learning and confidence-building. His willingness to help, coupled with his deep insight into IT, makes him an excellent mentor and an advocate for advancing women in technology.

I highly recommend Stanislav for any future mentoring roles, as his passion for diversity and empowerment truly elevates the quality of mentorship and strengthens the future of IT leadership.

I shared four years full of challenges and mutual inspiration with Stanislav. During that time, I was his fellow manager and also his mentor in leading his team. In hindsight, however, I contemplate who mentored whom more often. Stanislav has a unique ability to articulate context and add perspective on complex issues related to personal development. His insights enabled me to find solutions where I would have never looked for them myself, and which I would not have discovered without his help.

Stanislav has long been an inspiration to me, a mentor, a coach, and the person who brought me into IT. He has been a support to me and has continually pushed me forward. He never wavered and managed to describe the situation at hand and find solutions. Thanks to him, I am where I am today, and I am grateful for it. His energy during our conversations fascinated me and earned my admiration.

I had my first meeting with Stanislav Valášek, where we discussed the current state of my work team, which I would like to take to the next level.

Right from this first meeting, I am taking away several "aha moments" about what to focus on and what to change for us to function better as a team. I look forward to continuing and having further meetings with the whole team and Stanislav as the guide through this change. Thank you! 🙏👌

I went on a journey with Stanislav to Grosser Priel. It was my very first high-altitude experience, and I believe I couldn't have been in better hands. The whole journey was an incredibly powerful emotional experience. I overcame myself and got to know myself a little more. Stanislav handles any situation excellently and is a support and a true partner/guide. I recommend him to both beginners and experienced "mountaineers."
