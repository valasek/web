> I shared four years full of challenges and mutual inspiration with Stanislav. During that time, I was his fellow manager and also his mentor in leading his team. In hindsight, however, I contemplate who mentored whom more often.
> 
> Stanislav has a unique ability to articulate context and add perspective on complex issues related to personal development. His insights enabled me to find solutions where I would have never looked for them myself, and which I would not have discovered without his help.

> I went on a journey with Stanislav to Grosser Priel. It was my very first high-altitude experience, and I believe I couldn't have been in better hands. The whole journey was an incredibly powerful emotional experience. I overcame myself and got to know myself a little more. Stanislav handles any situation excellently and is a support and a true partner/guide. I recommend him to both beginners and experienced mountaineers.
