### Coaching is a synergy and collaboration for me

***I see my role in this collaboration as***
- discovering the resources and potential of the client
- assisting in identifying obstacles and finding strategies to deal with them
- continuous self-development and education to be a good partner in this collaboration

One aspect of coaching is the process through which I guide the client. Behind this process is the search for the client’s/team’s resources and continuous directing towards the client’s goals/intention. The second aspect is the broader context of the assignment. This is also part of my work. To see not only the detail but also the whole picture and to help the client expand their horizons when needed, through questions, feedback, exercises, and play.

***I obtained my coaching education in two places***
- a certified coaching program under the International Coaching Federation ([ICF](https://coachingfederation.org/)) at the [Business Coaching Academy](https://www.koucovaciaskola.sk/kurz-biznis-koucing).
- practical coaching experience in the last two companies, uLékaře.cz and DataArch, both based in Prague.

***My clients are diverse***
- Managers and Team Leaders
- Teams
- Business Owners
- Operational Staff  

It is not important to me what the assignment is; what matters is whether the client truly wants change and whether the person I am coaching is aligned with that change.
