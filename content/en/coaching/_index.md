#### Most common topics clients bring:

```markmap {height="200px"}
- ðŸ¤”
  - I want to understand and change my behavior  
  - I need find my inner motivation to reach my goal  
  - I want to make this decision in line with my life values  
  - I need help with career development  
  - I need a new perspective on my problem or opportunity  
  - Iâ€™m looking for balance between work, family, and hobbies  
  - I need support with growing my business or team  
  - How to improve the performance of my team  
```

Coaching is a partnership conversation where the coach is curious, supportive, gives honest reflection, and deeply believes that the client is the expert on their own life.

#### Why work with me?

Coaching is a tool, a space where people can think things through and **get clarity** on a topic theyâ€™re dealing with.

Itâ€™s done through a **partnership conversation**, where the client is the expert on their own life.

A coach helps clients gain **new perspectives and insights**.

By reframing thoughts, I help clients recognize helpful or unhelpful beliefs and find existing or **new resources** to make decisions aligned with their values. I help them realize what will **support them in taking action** and guide them with the right questions to define their own steps towards making that decision a reality.

For me, coaching is not about giving advice or offering solutions based on my view. Itâ€™s about kindly and **supportively helping clients discover their own resources** and reach their own insights.

I use the coaching conversation structure, ethical principles, and coaching competencies (as defined by the International Coaching Federation [ICF](https://coachingfederation.org)).

My typical clients are people who know they want change, know the area they want to change, and just need help to **define their direction and first steps** â€“ with someone who doesnâ€™t judge them, accepts them as they are, and supports them in their decisions.

What I enjoy most about coaching are two things:

1. Seeing and feeling the client's excitement when they find their own way forward.
2. The amount of internal work I do during every session to let go of my own good ideas and solutions, so I can stay in the role of a curious, supportive partner in this structured conversation.
