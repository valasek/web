### I coach individuals and teams

![](/images/coaching.jpg)

#### Most common topics clients bring:

* **Self-awareness** – I want to understand my own motivations, values, behavior patterns, and limiting beliefs, and learn to make more conscious life decisions.
* **Motivation** – I want to find my inner motivation to reach my goal and stay excited about what I do.
* **Purpose** – I need to make an important decision and want to make it in line with my life values and future vision.
* **Career growth** – I want a new responsibility or role, or I want to feel better in my current role and discover my professional options.
* **Problem solving** – I’m facing a challenge I can’t solve alone and need a new perspective and a structured approach.
* **Well-being** – I want to improve my quality of life, find better work-life balance, or manage stress more effectively.
* **Business challenges** – I need support with business growth, strategic decisions, or overcoming obstacles in business.
* **Team effectiveness** – I want to improve communication, collaboration, and performance in my team, or develop my leadership skills.

#### Why work with me?

Coaching is a tool, a space where people can think things through and **get clarity** on a topic they’re dealing with.

It’s done through a **partnership conversation**, where the client is the expert on their own life.

A coach helps clients gain **new perspectives and insights**.

By reframing thoughts, I help clients recognize helpful or unhelpful beliefs and find existing or **new resources** to make decisions aligned with their values. I help them realize what will **support them in taking action** and guide them with the right questions to define their own steps towards making that decision a reality.

For me, coaching is not about giving advice or offering solutions based on my view. It’s about kindly and **supportively helping clients discover their own resources** and reach their own insights.

I use the coaching conversation structure, ethical principles, and coaching competencies (as defined by the International Coaching Federation [ICF](https://coachingfederation.org)).

My typical clients are people who know they want change, know the area they want to change, and just need help to **define their direction and first steps** – with someone who doesn’t judge them, accepts them as they are, and supports them in their decisions.

What I enjoy most about coaching are two things:

1. Seeing and feeling the client's excitement when they find their own way forward.
2. The amount of internal work I do during every session to let go of my own good ideas and solutions, so I can stay in the role of a curious, supportive partner in this structured conversation.

My current rate is 70 € / hour. I’m not a VAT payer.

*The price includes phone and email availability for quick consultations during the coaching process.*

#### Testimonials

"His approach, focused on body awareness and inner experience, is a great guide to deeper self-understanding and finding solutions. Some of his suggestions surprised me at first, but they helped me realize many important things about myself.

This wouldn’t have been possible without the safe space and Stanislav’s sensitive and respectful approach – which he was able to create even online."

"Stanley always listens deeply and carefully to what the client says. Thanks to his experience and integrated systems, he can look at the problem from a higher perspective and help guide me toward my desired goal.

For me, he is a person with an open heart, and it’s clear that he feels more than he thinks."
