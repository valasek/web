One of my clients told me, "You ask such good questions." That was one of the motivations for why I started working with people through personal consultations.

The personal consultations that clients utilize overlap with coaching and mentoring, but I also draw on the knowledge I've gained on my own journey and through psychotherapy training. In my 10 years of working with people, I've gathered a lot of insights, starting with myself. I organized my own life first. I went through the best options I found on the market to learn more about myself, about people, and about the dynamics between them. What do clients come to me with?

- Relationship issues
- Parenting
- Sexuality
- Life direction
- Life challenges
- Emotional problems
- Depression

People find their way forward through our meetings, discovering solutions to their problems and issues. I am grateful for that.
