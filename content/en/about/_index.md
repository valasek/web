Hello. I am a former C-level manager (CTO), line and project leader, or leader in the agile transformation of product teams. For the past 20 years, I have worked in international companies in managerial positions in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the IT sector, in companies such as [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/sk/sk.html), [NESS](https://www.ness.com/ness-czech/), [Ataccama](https://www.ataccama.com/), or [uLékaře.cz](https://www.ulekare.cz/). You can find more about my career on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanislavvalasek/).

In the last 5 years, I have experienced many changes in both my personal and professional life.

I moved from the Czech Republic to Slovakia, and I am training to become a qualified coach under the auspices of the International Coaching Federation ([ICF](https://coachingfederation.org/)) at the [Business Coaching Academy](https://www.koucovaciaskola.sk/kurz-biznis-koucing).

I provide coaching and mentoring services for my clients or under the auspices of organizations like [Femme Palette](https://www.femmepalette.com/), [DoToho](https://dotoho.pro/), or [Tour De App](https://tourdeapp.cz/).

If you face a challenge and don't know where to start, or if you have a problem that seems unsolvable, don’t hesitate to contact me.

Choose [coaching](../coaching), [mentoring](../mentoring), or [book a free 30-minute online consultation](https://calendar.app.google/fNxKmJxX3D3HStkb9), or contact me [by phone or email](../contact), and together we can decide whether mutual collaboration makes sense or not.

I occasionally still program, mainly to stay in touch with trends or familiarize myself with new technologies and their applications. A list of software I have created can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/valasek/).
