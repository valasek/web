> I’m curious and honest — about myself, others, and the world around me.
> In many roles: as a man, father, manager, colleague, IT guy, mentor, and coach — but most of all, as a human being.
>
> I love deep and real conversations. I value honesty — with myself and with others.
>
> It brings me real joy when I or others can express ourselves clearly.
>
> What I enjoy the most is supporting people who are ready for change.
> Some want to change their inner attitudes or principles — I help them as a coach.
> Others want to improve how they communicate or take responsibility in their team — I support them through career mentoring or management mentoring.
>
> I deeply understand the work of managers, the world of IT, and how companies function. I enjoy finding connections that help set clear and fair rules.

In the past 5 years, I’ve gone through many changes — both personally and professionally.

I moved from the Czech Republic to Slovakia. I started working professionally as a coach and mentor for managers.

I continue learning through the International Coaching Federation ([ICF](https://coachingfederation.org/)) at the [Business Coaching Academy](https://www.koucovaciaskola.sk/kurz-biznis-koucing).

I provide coaching and mentoring services either directly or through organizations like [Femme Palette](https://www.femmepalette.com/), [DoToho](https://dotoho.pro/), and [Tour De App](https://tourdeapp.cz/).

If you’re facing a challenge, stuck with a decision, or unsure about your next step — don’t hesitate to contact me. We’ll talk and see if working together makes sense for you.

To stay connected with new trends, I still code from time to time. You can find my software work on [GitHub](https://github.com/valasek/).

Right now, I’m developing software to track my coaching clients and sessions. It’s currently free for all coaches at [www.findacoach.eu](http://www.findacoach.eu).
